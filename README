<p>Graph.pl is a Perl script I wrote to graph prices. It demonstrates my ability to take a CPAN module I'd never used before - in this case, GD:Graph - and integrate it into a fully functioning, useful program. The program starts by asking for a serial number; it removes stray punctuation marks using a simple regular expression and then uses that serial number to form the name of the file in which I have stored its associated prices. The script then stores these prices in an array, the y-axis array; it uses the number of prices (1 through n) for the x-axis array. Finally, it uses GD::Graph to graph the prices and save them in a .png file; in the last step, it opens the .png file using Preview. </p>

<p>I wrote this script to give myself an idea of the price history for individual Amazon items, over time. Almost all items on Amazon have a unique identifying serial number, so this program can be used for all kinds of goods. Price histories are important for pricing items, since values that persist over time are more important for establishing the value of an item than isolated highs and lows.</p>
